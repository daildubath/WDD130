                    If you've ever done a "powerpoint night", you know what this is:

                <p>
                    Does it make sense? No, but it leaves it open to the interpretation of the presenter. I originally had it a game: If someone in the audiance laughed or smiled, they were out. If everone laughed but one, that person one. They were aloud to ask questions as long as they were in. Last, if there were two
                    or more audience members are in, the presenter wins. This forces the presenter to be serious, while the audience members try to crack eachother up and ask dumb questions.
                    Great idea, right? Well, it didn't work at all. So don't try it. They ended up skipping the last 3 slides because they got board.

                    <p>I had to make a movie trailer like video for a book I read. I decided to read Legions, by Brandon Sanderson. Loved the book, highly recommend, but I spent days trying to get a video that worked.
                        finally, I just gave up. I took quick videos of friends, and recorded myself impromtu. The result was horrible, but actually kind of funny.

                <p>This was a pantomime for a theater class. I mixed the audio myself, and... the recordings horrible. For some reason, I was quite proud of this at the time.</p>

                    <p>I went through a phase making old spice ads. Not sure why, but had a ton of fun. Rule was, it had to be one take, and unedited. Are they good? Again, no. But.... 
                        they were fun. Enjoy
