    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a cybersecurity major at BYU Idaho currently, recently returning
      home from a mission in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Layton, Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made several videos, art projects, programs, and other content throughout the years,
      most of which has been lost. During high school I started writing poems. Though I knew I wasn't
      the best writer, I found joy in putting thoughts on paper. Most of my poems were quite silly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The video's and presentations are... strange to say the least, but they happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site contains nerrative about the content, but feel free to skip around and
      ignore the dialog.

    <h3>Poems</h3>
    <p>
      Before I start with the poems, just thought I would mention I took all the photos as well.
      I don't actually remember writing this first one, and it isn't a poem really either.
      All I know, is it was in my notes,
      and I wrote it before any of the others.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Holy Ghost
    </h4>
    <p>
      A voice is quiet amongst chaos no matter it’s volume. A truth is lost in a world of deceit no matter it’s value.
      But if close to your ear it can be heard, if close to your heart You will be stirred.
    </p>
    <p>My senior year was right after things opened up for Covid. Naturally, there was quite the buzz around the school
      when they announced they would hold prom, the first dance in over a year. Some of the most excited
      was a group of girls I knew from choir. They were known to go gossip in there own little circle during
      every lunch, and were quite rude to anyone they decided they disliked. Many of the girls seemed to have
      a new boyfriend every two weeks. Every time, it would end in some horrific fasion, and the news of
      how awful the boy was, always exagurated, would spread throughout the school. Well, none of them got
      asked to prom. They could not understand why, and they spent every lunch complaining. Every time I
      spoke to them they would beg for me to find them a date. I knew some people who hadn't asked anyone,
      but I never told them that. I couldn't do that to a friend. This poem was written after one of their
      rants:
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Senior Prom
    </h4>
    <p>
      Those girls in the circle, they giggle they goggle they gag,
    </p>
    <p>
      They talk bad about all the dumb boyfriends they’ve had.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tear them to shreds, they only see the worst,
    </p>
    <p>
      They gossip and gossip, they curse and they curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then prom rolls around and they show that they’re angry,
    </p>
    <p>
      Cause where are the men to call them their lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      They’ve gone for the sweet girls, the ones they call friends,
    </p>
    <p>
      For men have brains too and can see the girls’ trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that time period when people were kneeling during the
      national anthem, and many in the united states were talking about how
      horrible the nation was? Well, I do. That is when I wrote this poem.
      It wasn't meant to be offencive, I just was frustrated that people decided
      to hate the very thing that gave them the right to fight, and to be free,
      rather then steriotypes, laws, or poloticians. Set all political views
      asside, I will take no stance, the united states gives us the ability to
      have say.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a land of oppression men raised up a flag
    </p>
    <p>
      The flag stood for freedom and conquered the bad
    </p>
    <p>The people all rallied round the symbol of life,</p>
    <p>where success was the motivator over the knife.</p>
    <p>The flag flew higher and rose its bearers</p>
    <p>Who fought hard to end all oppressions and terrors</p>
    <p>But the people forgot what had given them rights</p>
    <p>They raised their own colors that they built upon lies</p>
    <p>They burned the old ensign, they forgot what was</p>
    <p>And oppression came new as the flag became dust</p>
    <p>
      The following three poems I wrote as challenges. I would ask a friend, "What should I write a poem on?" and what
      they said went.
      This first poem is my favorite, about kool-aid. Sadly, I think this might be the best poem I wrote.
    </p>
    <h4>Kool-Aid</h4>
    <p>Red or purple, and sweeter than candy</p>
    <p>It colors my lips no matter my handy</p>
    <p>The flavor burns as a cheap Walmart wine</p>
    <p>Drop in a hard egg and dye in the brine</p>
    <p>Though the pigments vary the flavor's the same</p>
    <p>Just sugar, acid, and artificial stain</p>
    <p>24 cents to waste away my life</p>
    <p>Stirring the powder with a butter knife</p>
    <p>I buy it the same for I cannot resist</p>
    <p>The taste of sweet water mixed with citrus</p>

    <p>A few months after I wrote this poem I came across and reread it,
      and I'll be honest: I don't quite know what I was getting at.
      Obviously I was implying cheeseburgers are better than hamburgers, and
      that when someone buys a hamburger they usually get it at a cheap joint. But why am
      I so rude about it? Isn't that a little unnecessary? I also find the consistency and flow
      interupted. I start by suggesting stuff be put on hamburgers, and then all
      of a sudden I'm not and insulting cheeseburgers, and then I finish by saying hamburgers
      aren't good. What am I even talking about? I don't know! But I wrote it, so it stays!
    </p>

    <h4>Hamburger or cheeseburger?</h4>
    <p>What is a hamburger when you can have cheese?</p>
    <p>Does it have lettuce, tomato’s, pickles at least?</p>
    <p>Is it delicious with it’s savory and sweet?</p>
    <p>Or is it made of dry bread and tough meat?</p>
    <p>The range is too great! Or are they the same?</p>
    <p>When it comes to range is cheeseburger to blame?</p>
    <p>It costs more, it has more, everywhere its been changed</p>
    <p>To fit the style of the restaurants name.</p>
    <p>So Don’t be fooled that hamburgers are good,</p>
    <p>Cause they aren’t.</p>

    <p>
      I have two things to say about this: first, I don't like ketchup very much.
      Second, I personally think all the other sauces are better! But I was asked to
      write a poem on how good ketchup was. (Weird to think everybody requested some
      kind of food...) This poem may have taken me the longest, which again, is embarrassing.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Ketchup
    </h4>
    <p>When I was young I tried a sauce,</p>
    <p>Whether orange or choral they said it was boss.</p>
    <p>So… I tried it, I loved it, but it’s true that I saw,</p>
    <p>That you could only buy fry sauce in the place called Utah. </p>
    <p>There’s one that is yellow, a disgusting hue,</p>
    <p>But it’s good on sandwiches if you know what to do,</p>
    <p>It’s common enough, but too much is too much,</p>
    <p>You can’t moisten with mustard if you use just a touch.</p>
    <p>But the white sauce! It moistens which pleases the pallet,</p>
    <p>But if you taste the stuff its cause you drank the whole packet</p>
    <p>Its just eggs and oil, it doesn’t have any flavor,</p>
    <p>Yes, mayonnaise just hasn’t got any savor. </p>
    <p>But the brown stuff, it does, it’s smoky and sweet,</p>
    <p>You can put it on anything that you call meat.</p>
    <p>But it’s a bit overbearing, it calls all attention,</p>
    <p>That’s why I put barbeque sauce alone in detention.</p>
    <p>It’s white with flecks, it only builds up!</p>
    <p>Just a little more flavor for one small cup,</p>
    <p>That is if with salad or mixed with Ragu</p>
    <p>Ranch is just too fancy for every food. </p>
    <p>What condiment fills my every need?</p>
    <p>Not buffalo, not A1, or sesame seed.</p>
    <p>I know just the one that plays the right part,</p>
    <p>Its Ketchup that will always win my heart.</p>

    <p>This next poem was inspired by Light Cleaveth Unto Light by Elder Timothy J. Dyches of the seventy (April 2021
      General conference) and hymn 284, If You Could Hie to Kolob </p>
    <p>In the black, cold, dark is nothing,</p>
    <p>No power, no energy, no gold.</p>
    <p>Glimmer, though dim, pierces and wins</p>
    <p>Vision within the hole.</p>
    <p>Hide the light, you lose also sight.</p>
    <p>Worth’s lost in dictating fear</p>
    <p>The mind whipped and harrowed by self sentenced sorrows </p>
    <p>Stands blind at the end of a pier</p>
    <p>Darkness flees to a tiny spark </p>
    <p>For fear of truth’s discover.</p>
    <p>Uncover its empty hungry abyss </p>
    <p>To color reality’s wonder.</p>
    <p>Beyond the night is endless,</p>
    <p>Worlds without number bright</p>
    <p>Majesty, divinity, joy for eternity</p>
    <p>If filled with the light.</p>

    <p>This last poem I wrote was the most recent, called Daddy's Girl</p>
    <h4>Daddy's Girl</h4>
    <p>He came to our home a little past six</p>
    <p>Drove a black dodge converted to stick</p>
    <p>He called her baby, she call him slick</p>
    <p>But I cannot control her</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The rest of her time was spent on the phone</p>
    <p>Texting and calling, he wasn't made known</p>
    <p>She keeps from the family not feeling alone</p>
    <p>But I cannot control her</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Giving up hobbies to play with emotions</p>
    <p>It's a dangerous game when it's set in motion</p>
    <p>I'd play it safe if I were given the option</p>
    <p>But I cannot control her</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>On the fifth of the month they didn't come back</p>
    <p>was three in the morning and the street pitch black</p>
    <p>I realized I'd lost her but not to my lack</p>
    <p>Because I cannot control her</p>

    <h3>Presentations and Videos</h3>
    <p>
      If you've ever done a "powerpoint night", you know what the above is.
      <iframe
        src="https://webmailbyui-my.sharepoint.com/personal/daildubath_byui_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={1e5d4b38-4c58-43c0-8d4b-ccf4cecb1dfc}&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777"
        width="1200px" height="707px" frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank"
          href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target="_blank"
          href="https://office.com/webapps">Office</a>.</iframe>
          Does it make sense? No, but it leaves it open to the interpretation of the presenter. I originally had
          it a game: If someone in the audiance laughed or smiled, they were out. If everone laughed but one, that
          person won. They were aloud to ask questions as long as they were in. Last, if there were two
          or more audience members still in, the presenter would win. This forces the presenter to be serious, while the
          audience members try to crack eachother up and ask dumb questions.
          Great idea, right? Well, it didn't work at all. So don't try it. They ended up skipping the last 3
          slides because they got bored.

    <p>The following was a silent film I had to make for a theater class:</p>

    <p>I had to make a movie trailer like video for a book I read. I decided to read Legions, by Brandon Sanderson.
      Loved the book, highly recommend, but I spent days trying to get a video that worked.
      finally, I just gave up. I took quick videos of friends, and recorded myself impromtu. The result was horrible,
      but actually kind of funny.

    <p>This was a pantomime for a theater class. I mixed the audio myself, and... the recordings horrible. For some
      reason, I was quite proud of this at the time.</p>

    <p>I went through a phase making old spice ads. Not sure why, but had a ton of fun. Rule was, it had to be one take,
      and unedited. Are they good? Again, no. But....
      they were fun. Enjoy

    <p>Images for the Presentation and Videos</p>
    <img src="images/heroption.jpg" alt="hero image">
    <p>Here is a question, I can include the photos, in fact, I wanted to put a lot of the photos I've taken on. I have
      about 50 more.
      However, I really don't want to resize them. Will the video's work? Or should I upload a seperate section for
      "scenic photos?"
      I was also thinking maybe using these under text, or as a hero, maybe even as a border for the video's. I can do
      any of those, but let
      me know in the comments on canvas what you think. I can ask Briggs too. First one is a hero idea, (white text on
      the black), second is an idea for text, or
      full background. They are pretty big because of that. Third, fourth, (or however many I add), are ideas too,
      especially if I do a full gallery. On that note,
      is there a way to do that that is built in with maybe google photos or something?
