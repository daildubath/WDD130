                <p>
                    I am a cybersecurity major at BYU Idaho currently, recently returning
                    home from a mission in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Layton, Utah.

                    I have made several videos, art projects, programs, and other content throughout the years,
                    most of which has been lost. During high school I started writing poems. Though I knew I wasn't
                    the best writer, I found joy in putting thoughts on paper. Most of my poems were quite silly.

                    The video's and presentations are... strange to say the least, but they happened. 
                    Also, some of my poems do not have names. If you have any ideas for me, let me know!

                    This site contains nerrative about the content, but feel free to skip around and 
                    ignore the dialog. All the photos I took and edited for fun as well.
