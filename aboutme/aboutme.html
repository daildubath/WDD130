    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <img src="images/Profile.jpg" alt="Andrew Benge">
    <p>My name is Andrew Benge, I'm majoring in Cybersecurity, and absolutly love programming! I admit I'm a little more excited to play with 
        CSS than I am with HTML. I play piano, guitar, and I sing. My favorite musical artists are Avi Kaplan,
         Peter Paul and Mary, Gordon Lightfoot, Alan Walker, Patsy Cline, Johnny Cash, Voces 8, Ola Gjielo, Roger Miller,
         and many, many more, with my favorite genre being Folk. I have a testimony of Jesus Christ, that he lives, that he loves us,
          and that he can and will help us. I believe in revelation, and know that God still speaks to us today.</p>
